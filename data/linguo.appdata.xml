  <description>
    <p>Linguo learns the keyboard layouts you use in each app and switches between them automatically depending on which app window is active.</p>
    <p>You can pre-define which layout Linguo must use for a specific app. For all the other apps, Linguo will set the layout depending on the similarity of the active app's name and window title with pre-defined o pre-learned layouts. Additionally, if you switch the layout manually (by using a shortcut only) while using any app (say, because Linguo did not make a good guess), Linguo will remember your choice and use it in the future.</p>
